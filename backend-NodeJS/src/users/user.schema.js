          ([\.-]?\w+)*: This matches zero or more groups that may start with a dot . or a dash -, followed by one or more word characters. This pattern matches parts of the email prefix separated by dots or dashes (like in first.last or first-last).

          @: This is the mandatory "at" symbol in the email address.

          \w+: After the @, there must be one or more word characters. This part typically matches the domain name (like example in example.com).

          ([\.-]?\w+)*: This is similar to the earlier group, allowing for domain subsections separated by dots or dashes (like example.co.uk).

          (\.\w{2,3})+$: This matches the top-level domain (TLD) which must be a dot followed by two to three word characters. It allows for emails with multiple dot-separated TLDs, like co.uk.
